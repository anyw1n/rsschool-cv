## Summary:
I am a third-year student of Francisk Skorina Gomel State University, specialty - computer physics. The creation of mobile applications began to attract me when I was in school. Since then I have decided that I will study to be a programmer. I have chosen the direction of developing mobile applications for several important reasons. The first is mobility. Phones are always with us, which means that the application will always be at hand. The second reason is that the developer deals with the backend and frontend. The third reason is the continuous development of technology, which will not let you get bored. I love to learn new things and put them into practice with ease.

## Skills:
* **Languages:** Swift
* **Architecture patterns:** MVC
* **Frameworks:** Foundation | UIKit | SnapKit | Alamofire | Kingfisher | SwiftLint
* **Database:** CoreData
* **VCS:** Git | Github | Bitbucket
* **Package Managers:** Cocoapods | Carthage | SPM

Got the experience of creating apps and projects with Xcode 11.4, using Carthage and
CocoaPods, Sourcetree and GitHub. Have an idea of developing iOS-applications in general
and basic knowledge of technologies used in the development. Have theoretical knowledge
of GCD, MVC.

Also familiar with such programming languages as: Kotlin, Java, C/C++/C#, Delphi, Pascal, PHP.

## Code example:
```swift
private func setupNavigationBarStyle() {
    let standartNavBar = UINavigationBar.appearance()
    standartNavBar.tintColor = UIColor(named: "accentColor")
    standartNavBar.prefersLargeTitles = true
    standartNavBar.largeTitleTextAttributes =
        [.foregroundColor: UIColor(named: "textColor") ?? UIColor.black]

    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
        let newNavBar = UINavigationBarAppearance()
        newNavBar.configureWithDefaultBackground()
        newNavBar.largeTitleTextAttributes =
            [.foregroundColor: UIColor(named: "textColor") ?? UIColor.black]
        standartNavBar.scrollEdgeAppearance = newNavBar
    }
}
```
